Custom serialization using Jackson
==================================

Jackson JSON provides many different ways to customize the serialization
process of a class, most of these methods utilise annotations on the
classes themselves. I recently had the requirement to customize the
serialization of a class when I had no access to change the source
code of that class. That meant that using annotations wasn't an
option and I had to find another way.

This project provides the example code used in a blog entry which
demonstrates how to customize the serialization process in Jackson.
